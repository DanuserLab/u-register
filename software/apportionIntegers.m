function intPer = apportionIntegers(fracs,total)
%APPORTIONINTEGERS apportions integer values with given fraction and total
% 
% intPer = apportionIntegers(frac,total)
% 
% This function apportions (sub-divides) the input total into integer
% sub-totals so that each sub-total has approximately the specified
% fraction of the total, and the sum of these sub-totals equals the input
% total. It uses Hamilton's method to do so. This problem is impossible to
% do without producing some potentially undesireable results (see Balinkski
% & Young, 1982), but this method will always maintain the input total.
% 
% Input:
%   
%   frac - An Mx1 or 1xM vector containing the fraction of the total to
%   apportion to each of the M output integers. This vector should sum to
%   1. Note that as stated above, these fractions will rarely be perfectly
%   satisfied in order to maintain the total.
% 
%   total - An integer specifying the desired sum of the M output integers.
% 
% 
% Output:
% 
%   intPer - The integer values apportioned based on each of the M input
%   fractions, having a sum equal to the input total
