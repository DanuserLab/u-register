function [cleanContours,iClean] = cleanUpContours(contoursIn,nPtsMin,minRange)
%CLEANUPCONTOURS removes redundant points and short contours from the input contours
%
% cleanContours = cleanUpContours(contoursIn)
% cleanContours = cleanUpContours(contoursIn,nPtsMin)
% [cleanContours,iClean] = cleanUpContours(contoursIn,nPtsMin)
% 
% Description:
% 
%   The contours returned by contours.m or contourc.m should first be
%   seperated into a cell array using separateContours.m. These contours
%   will often contain "redundant" points - multiple points in the same
%   pixel of the image which was contoured. (I'm not sure why this is...)
%   This function removes these points. Also, they may contain very short
%   contours which surround a single pixel. These contours will be removed
%   if they are shorter than nPtsMin.
% 
% 
% Input:
% 
%   contoursIn - A cell array containing the contours to process, as output
%                by separateContours.m
% 
%   nPtsMin - The minimum number of points a contour must contain to be
%             kept. Contours shorter than this will be removed. 
%             Optional. Default is 3 - just enough to make a triangle. 
% 
%   minRange - Minimum range of X or Y values to retain a contour. Any
%               contour where both the X and Y coordinates have a smaller
%               range than this will not be retained.
%               Optional. Default is 1.
% 
% Output:
% 
%   cleanContours - The contours with redundant points and short contours
%                   removied.
% 
%   iClean - The indices of the returned clean contours in the original
%            contour array.
