function [x0,y0,iout,jout] = intersectionsHLE(x1,y1,x2,y2,robust)
%INTERSECTIONSHLE Intersections of curves.
%
%   NOTE:Modified from version found on matlab exchange to fix a few bugs,
%   speed calculation, sort output etc. Part of this modification involves
%   removal of redundant intersections, and rounding of intersections
%   indices (iout, jout) slightly different from integer indices due
%   primarily to numerical error. If you need intersection indices which
%   are more precise than +/-1e-6, don't use this function. - HLE
%
%   Computes the (x,y) locations where two curves intersect.  The curves
%   can be broken with NaNs or have vertical segments.
%
% Example:
%   [X0,Y0] = intersections(X1,Y1,X2,Y2,ROBUST);
%
% where X1 and Y1 are equal-length vectors of at least two points and
% represent curve 1.  Similarly, X2 and Y2 represent curve 2.
% X0 and Y0 are column vectors containing the points at which the two
% curves intersect.
%
% ROBUST (optional) set to 1 or true means to use a slight variation of the
% algorithm that might return duplicates of some intersection points, and
% then remove those duplicates.  The default is true, but since the
% algorithm is slightly slower you can set it to false if you know that
% your curves don't intersect at any segment boundaries.  Also, the robust
% version properly handles parallel and overlapping segments.
%
% The algorithm can return two additional vectors that indicate which
% segment pairs contain intersections and where they are:
%
%   [X0,Y0,I,J] = intersections(X1,Y1,X2,Y2,ROBUST);
%
% For each element of the vector I, I(k) = (segment number of (X1,Y1)) +
% (how far along this segment the intersection is).  For example, if I(k) =
% 45.25 then the intersection lies a quarter of the way between the line
% segment connecting (X1(45),Y1(45)) and (X1(46),Y1(46)).  Similarly for
% the vector J and the segments in (X2,Y2).
%
% You can also get intersections of a curve with itself.  Simply pass in
% only one curve, i.e.,
%
%   [X0,Y0] = intersections(X1,Y1,ROBUST);
%
% where, as before, ROBUST is optional.

% Theory of operation:
%
% Given two line segments, L1 and L2,
%
%   L1 endpoints:  (x1(1),y1(1)) and (x1(2),y1(2))
%   L2 endpoints:  (x2(1),y2(1)) and (x2(2),y2(2))
%
% we can write four equations with four unknowns and then solve them.  The
% four unknowns are t1, t2, x0 and y0, where (x0,y0) is the intersection of
% L1 and L2, t1 is the distance from the starting point of L1 to the
% intersection relative to the length of L1 and t2 is the distance from the
% starting point of L2 to the intersection relative to the length of L2.
%
% So, the four equations are
%
%    (x1(2) - x1(1))*t1 = x0 - x1(1)
%    (x2(2) - x2(1))*t2 = x0 - x2(1)
%    (y1(2) - y1(1))*t1 = y0 - y1(1)
%    (y2(2) - y2(1))*t2 = y0 - y2(1)
%
% Rearranging and writing in matrix form,
%
%  [x1(2)-x1(1)       0       -1   0;      [t1;      [-x1(1);
%        0       x2(2)-x2(1)  -1   0;   *   t2;   =   -x2(1);
%   y1(2)-y1(1)       0        0  -1;       x0;       -y1(1);
%        0       y2(2)-y2(1)   0  -1]       y0]       -y2(1)]
%
% Let's call that A*T = B.  We can solve for T with T = A\B.
%
% Once we have our solution we just have to look at t1 and t2 to determine
% whether L1 and L2 intersect.  If 0 <= t1 < 1 and 0 <= t2 < 1 then the two
% line segments cross and we can include (x0,y0) in the output.
%
% In principle, we have to perform this computation on every pair of line
% segments in the input data.  This can be quite a large number of pairs so
% we will reduce it by doing a simple preliminary check to eliminate line
% segment pairs that could not possibly cross.  The check is to look at the
% smallest enclosing rectangles (with sides parallel to the axes) for each
% line segment pair and see if they overlap.  If they do then we have to
% compute t1 and t2 (via the A\B computation) to see if the line segments
% cross, but if they don't then the line segments cannot cross.  In a
% typical application, this technique will eliminate most of the potential
% line segment pairs.
