function smoothedMap = smoothActivityMap(matIn,varargin)
%SMOOTHACTIVITYMAP smooths the input 2D matrix and handles missing observations (NaNs)
% 
% smoothedMap = smoothActivityMap(matIn);
% smoothedMap = smoothActivityMap(matIn,'ParamName1',paramVal1,'ParamName2',paramVal2,...)
% 
%   This function returns a prettier, smoothed version of the input 2D
%   matrix (usually an activity map, e.g. protrusion velocity or
%   fluorescence samples from windows), and handles missing observations
%   (NaNs) by either interpolating to fill these areas or by ignoring them
%   in the smoothing process and leaving these areas blank.
%
%   NOTE: This function is intended to be used only for display/figure
%   making, and the resulting smoothed matrix should NOT be used for
%   analysis.
% 
%   Input:
% 
%       matIn - MxN 2D matrix (activity map) to smooth.
% 
%   Optional Parameters:
% 
%       ('SmoothParam' -> Scalar 0 <= x <= 1). The smoothing parameter to to
%       use to smooth the matrix (this is passed to csaps.m). Must be between
%       0 and 1 where 0 is the smoothest and 1 is least smoothing
%       (interpolating). 
%       Optional. Default is .99
%
%       ('UpSample' -> Positive integer scalar >= 1). Factor by which to
%       upsample. Output matrix will be larger than input matrix by this
%       factor.
%       Optional. Default is 5.
%
%       ('FillNaN' -> True/False) If true, areas with NaN will be filled in
%       with interpolated values. If false, smoothing will ignore these
%       areas. It is generally not a good idea to turn this option on
%       (true), because you are hiding holes in the data, unless these are
%       small holes or outliers (segmentation errors etc) which have been
%       removed. Even if it is off the data will still be smoothed around
%       these holes. 
%       Optional. Default is false.
%
%   Output:
%
%       smoothedMap - u*M x u*N smoothed 2D activity matrix, where u is the
%       upsample parameter.
