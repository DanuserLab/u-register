% 
% This function solves the selected partial differential equation (PDE)
% over the area enclosed by the vectors x and y given the vector-valued
% boundary conditions specified by the vectors u and v. The solution are
% found using the matlab PDE toolbox. The PDE must be of the form supported
% by the PDE toolbox function adaptmesh.m.
% 
% More specifically, the function finds the vector-valued solution u over
% the two dimensional domain omega defined by the input polygon xy, given
% the vector-valued Dirichlet boundary condition  u(omega) = uv. In the
% matlab PDE toolbox, vector valued solutions are treated as systems of
% equations. Therefore this corresponds to the solution of a system of
% elliptic PDEs
% 
% Input:
% 
%   xy - The 2xM or Mx2 matrix containing the x and y positions of the
%         boundary of the area to solve the PDE. These positions must form
%         a closed polygon (M>=3 and the last and first points are
%         adjacent).
% 
%   uv - The 2xM or Mx2 vectors containing the x and y components of the
%         boundary condition at each boundary point specified by xy.
%         Must be the same size as xy.
% 
%   pdePar - 1x3 Cell array specifying the parameters of the PDE to solve
%            in the object interior. The elements of this vector correspond
%            to the coefficients c, a and f used by the functions
%            assembpde.m and adaptmesh.m. See the help of assempde.m for
%            details on these coefficients and their specification.
%
%   imgSize - A 1x2 positive integer vector containing the size of the area
%             over which to solve the PDE. Areas outside of the area
%             specified by x and y will have zero values. Only used if X,Y
%             outputs are requested. Optional. If not specified, the X and
%             Y matrices will be just large enough to fit area enc)losed by
%             xy.
%
%   meshQualtiy - Integer scalar between 1-10. The quality of the
%                 triangular mesh to use when solving the PDE. Large
%                 numbers will DRASTICALLY increase computation time, while
%                 asymptotically decreasing error in the solution.
%                 Optional. Default is 3.
%
%   nonLin - 'off' or 'on' If 'on', the non-linear solver will be used.
%            This is required in cases where the PDE coefficients contain
%            the value of the solution OR it's first derivative. Optional.
%            Default is 'off' (use linear solver).
%
%
% Output:
%
%   [X,Y] - The rectangular matrices specifying the X and Y components of
%           the solution to the PDE at regularly spaced points within the
%           solution area. This output is slightly slower as it requires
%           that the solution defined on the triangular mesh be
%           interpolated to a homogeneous grid. 
%
%      ------------------------ OR -----------------------------
%
%   [u,p,e,t] -  The solution to the PDE on the triangular
%                mesh used by the PDE toolbox. This contains the solution
%                values uv, vertex locations p, edge topology e and
%                triangles t for the x and y components of the solution.
%                See assempde.m for details on their format.
